  aboutMe:
    `I'm an engineer with a strong background in low-level programming and image processing, focused on building and optimizing efficient vision systems. I work comfortably in Linux environments — both as a user and a system administrator — automating workflows, configuring systems, and writing scripts in Bash and Zsh.
    My daily toolbox includes Git, Docker, and Confluence, and I specialize in video and image processing using GStreamer, DeepStream, OpenCV, YOLO, and TensorRT. I primarily develop on NVIDIA Jetson platforms, designing solutions that balance hardware constraints with AI performance requirements.
    I have hands-on experience delivering end-to-end systems — from sensor integration and hardware setup to implementation, performance tuning, and documentation. I've also worked with ROS and containerized environments in drone and automation-related projects.
    I value open technologies, technical clarity, and close collaboration across engineering disciplines.`,
